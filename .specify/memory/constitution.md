# Vacation Budget Planner Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Offline-First Architecture
Data persistence must use AsyncStorage as the primary storage mechanism. The app MUST function completely without network connectivity. Cloud synchronization features are optional enhancements that cannot compromise offline functionality. All data operations must be designed with eventual consistency in mind for future cloud integration.

### II. Simple Data Models
Data structures must follow clear, minimal schemas: Vacation, BudgetItem, Checklist, ChecklistItem. Each model must have well-defined relationships and avoid complex nested structures. Database operations must be straightforward CRUD operations that can be easily tested and maintained.

### III. Minimal UX Design
User interfaces must prioritize efficiency with minimal taps to complete tasks. Budget summaries and remaining amounts must be clearly visible at all times. Navigation must be intuitive with clear visual hierarchy. Every screen must serve a specific, well-defined purpose in the vacation planning workflow.

### IV. Testable Modular Logic
Business logic must be separated into custom hooks and services that can be independently tested. Each module must have a single responsibility and clear interfaces. Testing must cover both unit-level logic and integration scenarios. Code must be organized to support easy mocking and dependency injection.

### V. Accessibility & Internationalization
The app must support scalable font sizes and high contrast modes. All interactive elements must be compatible with TalkBack and VoiceOver screen readers. Currency amounts and date formats must be localizable for international users. Color and iconography cannot be the sole means of conveying information.

## Data Management

Local data storage using AsyncStorage with JSON serialization. Data models must include version fields to support future migrations. Backup and restore functionality must be implemented through export/import features. All data operations must be atomic and include error handling for storage failures.

## User Experience Standards

Maximum 3 taps to reach any core functionality. Budget calculations must update in real-time. Form validation must be immediate and clear. Loading states must be implemented for any operation taking longer than 100ms. Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable.

## Governance

This constitution defines the non-negotiable requirements for the Vacation Budget Planner. All feature development must align with these principles. Code reviews must verify compliance with architectural decisions and UX standards. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit justification and documentation.

Amendments to this constitution require updated documentation, stakeholder approval, and a clear migration plan for existing code. Version control follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for principle removals/redefinitions, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications.
